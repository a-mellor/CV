A former underwriter turned web developer, who has just graduated from an intensive 16 week web development boot-camp at [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com/).

Previously working for a FinTech offering alternative business finance, I became interested in coding a year ago and spent a lot of time using online learning resources (Code Academy and EdX), but not getting as far as I'd like. I was lacking the ability to apply what I was learning. To be able to be become a developer I had to fully commit to coding, which lead to successfully gaining a place at Makers Academy.

Makers Academy is more than just a place that teaches you how to code, during my time I leant how to learn, providing me with the skills needed to quickly overcome new challenges such as tackling new languages and frameworks.

Along with learning how to code in Ruby and Javascript, I have leant industry best practices, building TDD, object-orientated web apps. I'm looking to work in a challenging and engaging environment that allows me to continue to learn, write test-driven code, apply SOLID and XP principles.
